I"’<p>i started working in web development a little over a year ago. when i was in college, i made a website for a portfolio for a class and it was way harder than i thought it was going to be. i hadnâ€™t done lots of (or any) web development, but i knew the basics around web development, like html tags and jQuery. when i entered the workforce and started my career, i was writing C and C++ building 10ft interfaces. that pipeline and that work was so different than what a lot of my friends were doing, and definitely not useful in building a website. i think i did alright [link to it here]. fast forward to 2021 and iâ€™m working at a company called lightstep, a webapp! iâ€™ve been here for a little more than a year, working in react mostly, but iâ€™ve learned so much more about web development than i did before. so i figured why not take another stab at making one of these! and make it a bit better ;)</p>
