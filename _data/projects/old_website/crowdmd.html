                    <h2>intro.</h2>
                    <p>CrowdMD was a product that resulted from work in the first class in Stanford's Human-Computer Interaction Department. My teammates and I worked together to find a way to consolidate responses to injury. One of our teammates was a varsity athelete at Stanford, and was very aware of the effects poor treatment could have following an injury. CrowdMD sought to improve those responses, by crowdsourcing remedies from individuals who experienced similar injuries.

                    <h2>process // generative research</h2>
                    <p>Our teammate who had a prior injury was able to provide important insights to guide our research. We shought to understand how different groups of people respond to injury. We expanded our scope and asked student atheletes, physically active students, non physically active students, and various adults with a range of physical habits.
                        <br>
                        <br> Some of the most useful insights gained were about how individuals decide to make decisions regarding their health. We learned that many individuals consult multiple sources to justify actions in times of need. This meant that by finding a way to crowd source actons that many people have taken, we were on the right path.</p>

                    <p>We then took our initial designs and brought them to potential users. Using their insights, we were able to improve and refine our design. We wanted to find the best possible way to lead users to a decision, based on the information crowdsourced prior. Users wanted to know how to separate a "good" solution from a "worse" solution. Numbers seemed like a clear way to do this, so by including percentages when presenting potential options, we thought it would be easier for users to then make a decision, leaving them appropriately informed moving forward.</p>

                    <h2>process // hi-fi</h2>
                    <p>After creating our medium fidelity prototypes, we took them to back to our users to further refine our ideas. One major insight we gathered was that using a number to measure pain was actually very difficult. We used that insight to justify changing to a relative pain scale. A 4.0 pain measurement may be difficult to quantify, but saying that something is 'Not Very Painful' versus 'Immobilizing Pain' gives more context. Along with that, we chose to try and add more context to the results- presenting information about the treatment, as well as quick comments, to help inform users even further.</p>
